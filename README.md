# AdventOfCode

## Description of the repo

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I implement C++ solutions for various problems on the Advent of Code platform.

Advent of Code is an online platform that offers a series of programming challenges every December. These challenges vary in complexity and theme, offering developers an opportunity to put their problem-solving and programming skills to the test. The platform is used by recruiters in particular, so it's very interesting to have already worked through the exercises!

This repository contains the solutions I've developed in C++ to solve these problems. I strive to provide efficient and well-documented solutions, following clean programming principles and using the latest features of the C++ language (c++23).
The aim of this repository is to provide a reference for those seeking to understand problem-solving approaches or who need inspiration for their own solutions. Solutions are organized by year and challenge day!


Please feel free to explore the various folders and files to discover solutions, and to contribute by submitting problems or suggestions for improvement.
Thank you for your interest in this repository, and happy programming on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! ðŸš€

## How to compile the code ?

I assume that the necessary installations are already in place (updated gcc, code editor).

Compile the code:

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```

The files supplied also enable code to be debugged in Visual Studio Code.
